'''
Solve all the below tasks related to indexing and slicing.

Keep in mind ðŸ§  The concept of indexing and slicing will come again in later weeks with list and tuple which are also sequences like string.

This exercise gives you practice in different indexing and slicing methods.

Problem Type: Input variable - Output Variable, Hidden suffix for evaluation
'''
# Sample inputs (# note: The values given in the prefix code(grey) will be changed by the autograder according to the testcase while running them.

s = "hello pyhton"
course_code = "24t2cs1002" # 24 - year, t2 - term 2, cs1002 - course id
# <eoi>

output1 =... # str: get the third character of s
print("Output1",output1)

output2 =... # str: get the fourth last character of s
print("Output2",output2)

output3 =... # str: get the first 3 characters of s
print("output3",output3)

output4 =... # str: get every second character of s
print("output4",output4)
#output12 = s[0:len(s):2] # str: get every second character of s

output5 =... # str: get the last 3 characters of s
print("output5",output5)


output6 =... # str: get the reverse of s
print("output6",output6)

course_term =... # int: get the term of the year as number from course_code
print("term",course_term)
course_year =... # int: get the year as two digit number from course_code
print("year",course_year)
