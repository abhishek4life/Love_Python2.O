# Sample inputs (# note: The values given in the prefix code(grey) will be changed by the autograder according to the testcase while running them.
a = 5

price1, discount1 = 50, 4 # for offer1
price2, discount2 = 60, 8 # for offer2

# Assume discount is given in percentages

# <eoi>

output1 =... # bool: True if a greater than or equal to 5
print("output1",output1)

output2 =... # bool: True if a is divisible by 5
print("output2",output2)

output3 =... # bool: True if a is odd number less than 10
print("output3",output3)

output4 =... # bool: True if a is an odd number within the range -10 and 10
print("output4",output4)

output5 = ...# bool: True if a has even number of digits but not more than 10 digits
print("output5",output5)

offer1_price =...
print("offer1_price",offer1_price)

offer2_price =...
print("offer2_price",offer2_price)

is_offer1_cheaper =... # bool: True if the offer1 is strictly cheaper
print(is_offer1_cheaper)
